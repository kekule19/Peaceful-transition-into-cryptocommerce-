# Peaceful-transition-into-cryptocommerce-




The invention of cryptography technology, coupled with worldwide networks, changes the economics of defense and attack of today’s legal systems. This change is greater than going from the bow and arrow to the gun. Once again, society will have to self-organize around this change to reach a new equilibrium.



cryptocommerce is a new level of commerce we must embrace. Simply pointing to negative uses of cryptocommerce technologies is like pointing out that writing allows people to write down instructions to kill, or that the internet lets people publish bomb-building instructions. Preventing those technologies would have suppressed their emergent beneficial effects without our realizing what we missed. 


How we can move into cryptocommerce 

cryptocommerce will make the world more free , so we can take the following steps for peaceful transition into cryptocommerce. 

1. The world changes by  building a protected sphere outside the reach of government like like Ayn Rand’s famous “Galt’s Gulch”.



2. the world changes by exploiting gray areas in regulations and law, like much of the internet was built. Most startups didn’t know if what they were doing was legal, but they did it and it led to lots of change.


3. Cryptocommerce needs magic of winning over customers . 

4. We should try create a secure and reliable cryptocommerce.
